# Explainable Cardiovascular Defect and Disease Detection with Graph Networks
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to pose a significant global health burden, necessitating the development of advanced predictive models for early intervention and personalized care. Prediction of heart disease along with effective ECG data classification is essential for developing early diagnoses and enhanced patient outcomes. This research implements a new methodology that uses GATs with TGNs for predictive capability enhancement and implements LIME for interpretability improvement. The clinical data analyzes multiple patient attribute relationships using GATs while TGNs detect ECG signal temporal features. The integrated modeling system delivers 92.71% accuracy in identifying heart disease cases with 96.33% accuracy for detecting ECG abnormalities better than conventional techniques. Explainability techniques help improve transparency through actionable information on major risk factors and time-dependent features that affect predictions. The diagnostic accuracy becomes stronger through this approach while it supports customized healthcare measures demonstrating the potential value of graph-based models for cardiovascular disease treatment
